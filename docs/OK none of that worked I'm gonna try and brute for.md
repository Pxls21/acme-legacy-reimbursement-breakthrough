# OK none of that worked I'm gonna try and brute force my way through this.

what's the fastest (preferably gpu accelerated) tools and python libraries that willl allow me to search everything in a bruuteforce but faster

Given that nuanced AI approaches have failed and you're pivoting to a brute-force strategy, speed is paramount. The goal is to evaluate millions or even billions of potential calculation formulas against the 1,000 historical cases to find one that produces exact matches. This is a massively parallel problem, making it a perfect fit for GPU acceleration.

Here are the fastest GPU-accelerated tools and Python libraries to build a high-velocity brute-force engine.

### High-Level Strategy: Parallel Formula Evaluation

The core idea is to generate a massive number of candidate formulas and then use the GPU to test all of them against all 1,000 historical data points simultaneously.

1. **Define the Search Space:** Identify the building blocks of your formulas:
    * **Variables:** `duration`, `miles`, `receipts`.
    * **Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `if/else` conditions.
    * **Constants:** Magic numbers for mileage rates (e.g., 0.58, 0.62), per diems (e.g., 50, 75), bonus thresholds (e.g., 5 days), etc.
2. **Generate Formulas:** Systematically combine these building blocks into millions of candidate formulas.
3. **GPU Evaluation:** Load the 1,000 historical cases onto the GPU. In a single pass, apply every candidate formula to the entire dataset and compare the results to the known correct reimbursement amounts.
4. **Identify Winners:** Isolate the formulas that achieve the highest number of exact matches.

### Top GPU-Accelerated Python Libraries for Brute-Forcing

#### 1. NVIDIA RAPIDS cuML: Brute-Force Hyperparameter Tuning

While your initial decision tree approach failed to find exact rules, you can supercharge it with GPU acceleration to perform a massive brute-force search of its parameters. NVIDIA's cuML provides a GPU-accelerated drop-in replacement for scikit-learn, boasting speed-ups of up to 50x[^5].

**How it helps:**
You can use a GPU-accelerated `GridSearchCV` to test thousands of combinations of decision tree parameters (like `max_depth`, `min_samples_leaf`, `criterion`) in the time it would take to test a few dozen on a CPU. This is a form of automated brute-force search for the best rule structure.

**Implementation:**

```python
# Make sure cuML is installed and enabled in your environment
%load_ext cuml.accel
import sklearn # This now uses the GPU backend
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
import numpy as np

# Define a massive search space for the decision tree's parameters
param_grid = {
    'max_depth': np.arange(3, 20), # Test 17 different depths
    'min_samples_split': np.arange(2, 40), # Test 38 split points
    'criterion': ['squared_error', 'absolute_error'] # Test 2 criteria
}
# Total models to train = 17 * 38 * 2 = 1292 models

# X_train, y_train are your 1000 historical cases
tree = DecisionTreeRegressor()

# This grid search will run dramatically faster on the GPU
grid_search = GridSearchCV(tree, param_grid, cv=3, n_jobs=-1, scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# The best model found after brute-forcing the parameters
best_tree = grid_search.best_estimator_
```


#### 2. CuPy: The Core Brute-Force Engine

CuPy is a GPU-accelerated library with a NumPy-compatible API[^3]. This is the workhorse for your custom formula evaluation. Instead of looping through formulas one by one on a CPU, you can represent your data and formulas as large matrices and perform the calculations in a single, massive GPU operation.

**How it helps:**
It allows you to test tens of thousands of formula variations against all 1,000 historical cases in milliseconds.

**Implementation Concept:**

```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np

# 1. Load historical data onto the GPU
# (Assuming 'data' is a NumPy array of shape (1000, 4) with [duration, miles, receipts, correct_reimbursement])
gpu_data = cp.asarray(data)
durations = gpu_data[:, 0]
miles = gpu_data[:, 1]
receipts = gpu_data[:, 2]
correct_reimbursements = gpu_data[:, 3]

# 2. Generate a large batch of candidate formulas (e.g., 100,000 variations)
# Example: Test 1000 different mileage rates and 100 per diem rates
mileage_rates = cp.linspace(0.10, 1.50, 1000)
per_diem_rates = cp.linspace(20, 120, 100)

# 3. Evaluate in parallel on the GPU
# Create a (1000, 1000) grid of results for mileage rates
# Each column represents a different rate applied to all 1000 trips
calculated_reimbursements = miles[:, cp.newaxis] * mileage_rates

# 4. Find matches
# Compare all 1,000,000 results against the correct values
# The result is a boolean matrix showing which formula worked for which case
matches = cp.isclose(calculated_reimbursements, correct_reimbursements[:, cp.newaxis], atol=0.01)

# 5. Count successes for each formula
# Summing down the columns tells you how many exact matches each mileage rate got
scores = cp.sum(matches, axis=0)
best_rate_index = cp.argmax(scores)
best_mileage_rate = mileage_rates[best_rate_index]

print(f"Best mileage rate found: {best_mileage_rate} with {scores[best_rate_index]} exact matches.")
```


#### 3. Numba: For Complex, Non-Vectorizable Logic

Sometimes, your formulas will involve conditional logic (`if/else`) that is difficult to express in the clean matrix operations of CuPy. Numba allows you to write custom Python functions (with loops and conditionals) and JIT-compile them into highly optimized CUDA kernels that run directly on the GPU[^3].

**How it helps:**
It gives you the flexibility of writing regular Python code with the raw performance of a custom CUDA kernel, perfect for brute-forcing complex, tiered rule systems.

**Implementation:**

```python
from numba import cuda
import numpy as np

@cuda.jit
def evaluate_complex_formulas_gpu(durations, miles, receipts, results_out):
    # Get the unique thread ID for this GPU thread
    idx = cuda.grid(1)

    # Make sure we don't go out of bounds of our data
    if idx < durations.size:
        duration = durations[idx]
        mile = miles[idx]

        # --- BRUTE-FORCE LOGIC INSIDE THE KERNEL ---
        # This is an example of a tiered mileage rule from Lisa's insights
        reimbursement = 0.0
        if mile <= 50:
            reimbursement = mile * 0.75 # Hypothesis 1
        else:
            reimbursement = (50 * 0.75) + ((mile - 50) * 0.45) # Hypothesis 2

        # Add a per diem bonus based on trip duration
        if duration > 5:
            reimbursement += 250.0 # Hypothesis 3

        results_out[idx] = reimbursement

# This would be inside a loop where you dynamically generate and compile
# many different versions of the above kernel.
```


#### 4. Hashwise: A Conceptual Model for Brute-Forcing

While Hashwise is designed to brute-force cryptographic hashes, its API provides an excellent conceptual model for what you're trying to do[^6]. It has a function `brute_force_hash` that takes a target value, a set of possible characters, and a length, then uses the GPU to find the input that produces the target hash.

**How it helps:**
You can architect your solution similarly:

* `target`: The correct reimbursement amount for a given case.
* `possible_elements`: Your list of operators (`+`, `*`), variables (`miles`), and constants (`50`, `0.58`).
* `hash_algorithm`: Your custom formula evaluator function.

This library proves that GPU-accelerated brute-forcing for this type of problem is a viable strategy[^6].

### A Pragmatic Brute-Force Workflow (8-Hour Plan)

1. **Hours 1-2: Setup and Search Space Definition.**
    * Install `cuml`, `cupy`, and `numba`. Ensure your NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit are correctly configured.
    * Based on employee insights, create a definitive list of all possible constants, variables, and operators. This is the most critical step.
2. **Hours 3-5: Build the CuPy Evaluator.**
    * Focus on the vectorized approach with CuPy first, as it's the fastest for simple formulas.
    * Write Python scripts to generate permutations of simple formulas (e.g., `miles * rate + flat_fee`).
    * Use the CuPy pattern above to evaluate millions of these simple formulas. Log any that get more than a few exact matches.
3. **Hours 6-7: Build the Numba Evaluator for Complex Rules.**
    * If simple formulas don't work, start implementing the tiered and conditional logic from the employee insights (e.g., "if duration > 5 AND miles < 100...").
    * Write a Numba JIT-compiled kernel for this. Because compiling has overhead, you'll test fewer, but more complex, rule sets.
4. **Hour 8: Analyze and Present.**
    * Collect your "winning" formulas. Even if none achieve 70% accuracy, finding a formula that gets 10-20% exact matches is a massive breakthrough.
    * Your presentation is not just about the answer but the powerful, scalable GPU-accelerated methodology you built to find it.
