## DEBUGGING

## EMPLOYEE INTERVIEWS (ACME CORP LEGACY TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM)

The employee interviews are goldmines of conflicting theories and observations regarding the 60-year-old legacy travel reimbursement system.

### Marcus (Sales) - The Frustrated User
- Same trips get different reimbursements inexplicably
- Thinks there might be **monthly quotas** or **calendar effects**
- Believes longer trips have a "sweet spot" around 5-6 days
- Suspects the system **rewards hustle** (high miles + lots of meetings)

### Lisa (Accounting) - The Data Observer
- Sees **5-day trip bonuses** consistently (but with exceptions)
- Identified **tiered mileage calculations** - first 100 miles at full rate, then drops
- Found **receipt spending curves** - medium amounts ($600-800) get best treatment
- Noticed **rounding bugs** when receipts end in 49 or 99 cents

### Kevin (Procurement) - The Obsessive Analyst
- Most detailed theories with **spreadsheet analysis**
- Identified **efficiency sweet spots**: 180-220 miles/day for maximum bonuses
- **Optimal spending ranges** based on trip length
- **Timing effects**: Tuesday submissions beat Friday by 8%
- Claims **lunar cycle correlations** (new moon = 4% higher reimbursements!)
- Believes there are **6 different calculation paths** based on trip characteristics
- **Kevin's Claimed 6 calculation paths**: The system may have more than 3 clusters; explore up to 8 clusters during pattern discovery. Note: The original theory was 6 paths, but the updated version found 9.

## REVERSE ENGINEERING CHALLENGE: ACME CORP LEGACY TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM (REVISED 2025-06-08)

### Challenge Overview

Tasked with reverse-engineering a 60-year-old legacy travel reimbursement system at ACME Corp.

-   **No one knows how it works**: original engineers are gone, source code is inaccessible, no documentation exists.
-   **It's still used daily** despite being a complete black box.
- 8090 built a new system, but ACME is confused by the different results.
-   **Your mission**: Figure out the original business logic to explain why the new system is different (and hopefully better).

### Input Data
The system takes exactly 3 parameters:
- `trip_duration_days` (integer) - Number of days traveling
- `miles_traveled` (integer) - Total miles driven
- `total_receipts_amount` (float) - Total dollar amount of receipts

### Output
- Single reimbursement amount (float, 2 decimal places)

### Resources
1. 1,000 historical input/output examples in `public_cases.json`
2. Employee interviews with various theories about how the system behaves (see "EMPLOYEE INTERVIEWS" section above).
3. 5,000 private test cases (without answers) for final evaluation.

### Technical Challenge

Create a `run.sh` script that:
- Takes the 3 input parameters
- Outputs just the reimbursement number
- Runs in under 5 seconds per case
- **Matches the legacy system exactly** - including any bugs!
- **The "private answers.txt" file**: This file should contain your predicted reimbursement amounts for each of the 5,000 private test cases.

### Success Criteria

- **Exact matches** (within ±$0.01): The gold standard
- **Close matches** (within ±$1.00): Still pretty good
- **Average error**: Lower is better
- Final evaluation against 5,000 private cases

### Strategy for Limited Time (8-Hour Sprint)

Given only 8 hours, a data-driven sprint approach is critical.

**Hour 1-2: Rapid Data Analysis & Pattern Discovery**

1.  Create Python analysis script to find basic patterns:
    *   Base per diem rates
    *   Mileage calculation tiers
    *   Receipt handling curves
    *   5-day bonus validation
2.  Quick wins from interviews:
    *   Test Kevin's "180-220 miles/day efficiency sweet spot"
    *   Validate Lisa's "5-day bonus" theory
    *   Check for mileage tier breaks at ~100 miles

**Hour 3-4: Build MVP Algorithm**

Based on patterns found, build a simple formula:

```
reimbursement = base_per_diem(days) + mileage_calc(miles) + receipt_bonus(receipts) + bonuses/penalties
```

**Hour 5-6: Iterative Refinement**

Use `eval.sh` frequently to test improvements:

*   Add threshold effects
*   Tune parameters
*   Add interaction terms

**Hour 7-8: Final Optimization**

Focus on the highest-error cases to identify missing logic

### Strategic Pivot: Rule Discovery Approach (added 2025-06-07)

-   For reverse-engineering the ACME Corp legacy travel reimbursement system, a rule-discovery system is preferred over continuous optimization approaches like genetic algorithms due to the system's likely discrete, rule-based nature.
-   The legacy system likely contains hard thresholds (5-day bonuses, mileage tiers), discrete calculation paths, rounding bugs, and interaction effects.
-   The goal is to achieve exact matches, not just close approximations.
-   If the Genetic Algorithm stagnates, pivot to rule-discovery.

### Rule Discovery Implementation Details (added 2025-06-07)

-   Location of `rule_discovery_system.py` is `presentation_final/rule_discovery_system.py`

### Advanced Pattern Matching and Anomaly Detection (added 2025-06-07)

-   Consider using `stumpy` and `adtk` for pattern matching and anomaly detection, even though this is not traditional time series data. These tools might be effective for identifying discrete calculation paths within the legacy system.
-   `public_cases.json` contains the training data.
-   The goal is to use `stumpy` and `adtk` to discover distinct calculation patterns and build separate models for each cluster.
-   The STUMPY approach should identify distinct calculation paths and handle high-receipt cases.
-   If the STUMPY approach does not reach "perfect replica" standards, fine-tune cluster count, improve feature engineering, enhance individual cluster models, and add rounding/precision handling.

### STUMPY Pattern Discovery Breakthrough for ACME Corp Challenge (added 2025-06-07)

**NOTE:** The claimed breakthrough of 89% improvement and 645 exact matches has been found to be false. The parameters that found 645 exact matches before are now getting 0-2, and the error is huge. The root cause is that the cluster assignments are wrong.

#### Results

-   **Not yet achieved**: Perfect replica fidelity
-   **Needs More Tuning**: (Current MAE: $144.99)

### STUMPY Precision Final (added 2025-06-07)

-   The approach now combines STUMPY pattern discovery with exact rule extraction.
-   **Current State Analysis**
    -   **What's Working:**

    -   **What Needs Fixing:**
        -   MAE: $144.99 (Target: <$5)
        -   Exact matches: 0.1% (Target: >70%)
        -   ML models are approximating when we need exact calculations
-   **Solution:** Hybrid Rule Extraction System
-   **Key File**: `stumpy_precision_final.py` (location: `top-coder-challenge/presentation_final/stumpy_precision_final.py`)

### STUMPY Precision Final Analysis and Next Steps (added 2025-06-07)

- Root Cause Analysis: The issue is that even within each cluster, linear regression isn't capturing the exact calculation logic. We need to move beyond statistical approximation to **formula reconstruction**.
- Consider using `hypothesis` to aid in formula reconstruction, even though it is primarily a unit testing library.
- **Hybrid Approach: STUMPY + Hypothesis + Symbolic Regression**: Combine pattern discovery, property-based testing, and automated formula reconstruction.

### ACME Corp Legacy System: Bridging Pattern Discovery to Precise Rule Extraction (added 2025-06-07)

- The core blocker preventing exact rule reconstruction lies in the translation layer between pattern clusters and executable business logic.
-   **Key Files**
    -   ACME_Legacy_System_PRD.md

### Key Insight: We Need Symbolic Regression, Not Parameter Search (added 2025-06-07)

The legacy system likely uses:
1. **Non-linear functions** (logarithms, exponentials, trigonometric)
2. **Complex conditional logic** (nested if-then-else structures)
3. **Historic calculation quirks** accumulated over 60 years

- ✅ Template-based extraction works for structured data

#### Revolutionary Implementation Strategy

1. **Replace** symbolic regression with **RuleFit** on our STUMPY clusters
2. **Add** financial rounding behavior analysis (Kevin's insights about efficiency thresholds)
3. **Implement** decision boundary detection for exact thresholds
4. **Use** template-based extraction for each cluster's calculation pattern

This research-backed approach directly targets our **pattern-to-rule translation gap**!

### New Rule Extraction Approach (added 2025-06-07)
